ðŸ“Œ Customer feedback skews heavily toward the free apps, suggesting business to adopt free-to-use approach supported by in-app purchases, or tiered upgrades, for visibility and user engagement.

ðŸ“Œ High review volume in Communication and Social apps highlight user demand for interactive and community-driven platforms.

**4. User Sentiment & Engagement Trends**

![User Sentiment & Engagement Trends](screenshots/User_Sentiment_&_Engagement_Trends.png)

ðŸ“Œ With over 99% of installs coming from free apps, businesses should adopt free-to-use models with monetization via ads or in-app purchases.

ðŸ“Œ The surge in 2018 indicates late adoption or viral growth triggers - ideal for launching new apps around major trend years or global shifts.

ðŸ“Œ Apps in Communication, Video players and Social genres suggest exponential adoption - invest in these areas for higher ROI.

ðŸ“Œ Use year-wise install trend to time releases during high-growth periods (like Q1 2018) or replicate similar market conditions.

ðŸ“ŒApps priced above $5 see drastically fewer installs - stay below this threshold to maximize reach.

## Strategies to implement:

 **Freemium apps:**    Prioritize free apps, with in-app purchases for maximum reach and user engagement. 

 **Family-focused Content:**   Focus on family & inclusive categories to capture broader audiences. 

 **Pricing Strategy:** Keep pricing below $5 unless offering high-value features. 

**Future launch:** Historical install surges can be used for future launches of apps for market spikes.
